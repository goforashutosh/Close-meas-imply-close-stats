We use information theoretic techniques in our proof. Our proofs also extend to the high value regime (value close to 1) and provide alternate proofs for the parallel repetition theorems of Holenstein and Rao for general and projection games respectively. We also extend the example of Feige and Verbitsky to show that the small-value parallel repetition bound we obtain is tight. Our techniques are elementary in that we only need to employ basic information theory and discrete probability in the small-value parallel repetition proof.},

@article{Tomamichel12,
  abstract      = {Despite enormous theoretical and experimental progress in quantum cryptography, the security of most current implementations of quantum key distribution is still not rigorously established. One significant problem is that the security of the final key strongly depends on the number, M, of signals exchanged between the legitimate parties. Yet, existing security proofs are often only valid asymptotically, for unrealistically large values of M. Another challenge is that most security proofs are very sensitive to small differences between the physical devices used by the protocol and the theoretical model used to describe them. Here we show that these gaps between theory and experiment can be simultaneously overcome by using a recently developed proof technique based on the uncertainty relation for smooth entropies.},

  abstract   = {Randomness is a vital resource for modern-day information processing, especially for cryptography. A wide range of applications critically rely on abundant, high-quality random numbers generated securely. Here, we show how to expand a random seed at an exponential rate without trusting the underlying quantum devices. Our approach is secure against the most general adversaries, and has the following new features: cryptographic level of security, tolerating a constant level of imprecision in devices, requiring only unit size quantum memory (for each device component) in an honest implementation, and allowing a large natural class of constructions for the protocol. In conjunction with a recent work by Chung et al. [2014], it also leads to robust unbounded expansion using just 2 multipart devices. When adapted for distributing cryptographic keys, our method achieves, for the first time, exponential expansion combined with cryptographic security and noise tolerance. The proof proceeds by showing that the R\'{e}nyi divergence of the outputs of the protocol (for a specific bounding operator) decreases linearly as the protocol iterates. At the heart of the proof are a new uncertainty principle on quantum measurements and a method for simulating trusted measurements with untrusted devices.},

@article{Reichardt13,
  abstract      = {Quantum computation and cryptography both involve scenarios in which a user interacts with an imperfectly modelled or `untrusted'system. It is therefore of fundamental and practical interest to devise tests that reveal whether the system is behaving as instructed. In 1969, Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt proposed an experimental test that can be passed by a quantum-mechanical system but not by a system restricted to classical physics. Here we extend this test to enable the characterization of a large quantum system. We describe a scheme that can be used to determine the initial state and to classically command the system to evolve according to desired dynamics. The bipartite system is treated as two black boxes, with no assumptions about their inner workings except that they obey quantum physics. The scheme works even if the system is explicitly designed to undermine it; any misbehaviour is detected. Among its applications, our scheme makes it possible to test whether a claimed quantum computer is truly quantum. It also advances towards a goal of quantum cryptography: namely, the use of `untrusted'devices to establish a shared random key, with security based on the validity of quantum physics.},

The precise definitions of the informationally coherent N-component system are presented in terms of the state (observable) dependent index of correlation. The informational coherence of the N-particle GHZ system in an entangled pure state is analysed and it is found that the observable-dependent index of correlation is less than or equal to the state-dependent one divided by N. It is pointed out that the informationally coherent quantumsystems violate the Bell theorem.}

  abstract  = {This paper proposes and studies new quantum version of f-divergences, a class of functionals of a pair of probability distributions including Kullback--Leibler divergence, Renyi-type relative entropy and so on. distance. There are several quantum versions so far, including the one by Petz (Rev Math Phys 23:691--747, 2011, [1]). We introduce another quantum version ({\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathrm {\{}D{\}}{\_}{\{}f{\}}^{\{}{\backslash}max {\}}{\$}{\$}, below), defined as the solution to an optimization problem, or the minimum classical f-divergence necessary to generate a given pair of quantum states. It turns out to be the largest quantum f-divergence. The closed formula of {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathrm {\{}D{\}}{\_}{\{}f{\}}^{\{}{\backslash}max {\}}{\$}{\$}is given either if f is operator convex, or if one of the state is a pure state. Also, concise representation of {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathrm {\{}D{\}}{\_}{\{}f{\}}^{\{}{\backslash}max {\}}{\$}{\$}as a pointwise supremum of linear functionals is given and used for the clarification of various properties of the quality. Using the closed formula of {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathrm {\{}D{\}}{\_}{\{}f{\}}^{\{}{\backslash}max {\}}{\$}{\$}, we show: Suppose f is operator convex. Then the maximum f-divergence of the probability distributions of a measurement under the state {\$}{\$}{\backslash}rho {\$}{\$}and {\$}{\$}{\backslash}sigma {\$}{\$}is strictly less than {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathrm {\{}D{\}}{\_}{\{}f{\}}^{\{}{\backslash}max {\}}{\backslash}left( {\backslash}rho {\backslash}Vert {\backslash}sigma {\backslash}right) {\$}{\$}. This statement may seem intuitively trivial, but when f is not operator convex, this is not always true. A counter example is {\$}{\$}f{\backslash}left( {\backslash}lambda {\backslash}right) ={\backslash}left| 1-{\backslash}lambda {\backslash}right| {\$}{\$}, which corresponds to total variation distance. We mostly work on finite dimensional Hilbert space, but some results are extended to infinite dimensional case.},

The framework shows how to interpret the result of such a strategy and how to define its accuracy when applied to a quantum system. Furthermore, we show how the accuracy of any strategy relates to its accuracy in its classical usage, which is well understood for the important examples. We show the usefulness of our framework by using it to obtain new and simple security proofs for the following quantum-cryptographic schemes: BB84 quantum-key-distribution, and quantum oblivious-transfer from bit-commitment.},
